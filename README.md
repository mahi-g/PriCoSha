# PriCoSha
PriCoSha is a web based application for privately sharing content items among groups of people (Friend groups). PriCoSha gives users somewhat more privacy than many content sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which content items they post and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a user's personal information.
Functionalities include: creating Friend Groups, making the content public/private, commenting, tagging and adding a new friend.
